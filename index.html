    <em>“You did it!” sobbed Winston. “You reduced me to this state.” “No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the Party. It was all contained in that first act. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.”</em> <br><br>- Orwell, George. Animal Farm and 1984 (p. 347). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.
